# Student-droput-prediction

## Project Overview
This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Studentdropout.ipynb`). It demonstrates the use of Python for data analysis, visualization, and insights generation. The notebook contains step-by-step code and explanations.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations using Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Basic statistical insights
- Custom functions for analysis

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Studentdropout.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells step by step.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Output
The notebook will generate:
- Cleaned dataset previews
- Graphs and charts for analysis
- Summary statistics
- Insights based on the dataset
